# Clustering-Antarctic-Penguin-Species-Project
Origin of this data : Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

The dataset consists of 5 columns:

- culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
- culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
- flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
- body_mass_g: body mass (g)
- sex: penguin sex

Unfortunately, they have not been able to record the species of penguin, but they know that there are three species that are native to the region: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo, so your task is to apply your data science skills to help them identify groups in the dataset!
